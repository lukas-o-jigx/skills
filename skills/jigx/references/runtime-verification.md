# Verify the runtime journey

Use this for new solutions or changes to forms, persistence, sync or submission.
Scale verification to the affected journey; cosmetic edits do not require full
integration testing. Respect existing publication authorization; this introduces
no additional approval requirement.

## Generated artifact checks

After building, run `node <skill-directory>/scripts/check-runtime.mjs build/output.json`.
Copy the dependency-free script into the project to include it in repeatable local/CI
verification. It fails on known runtime-contract errors and reports warnings:
undeclared state, unreachable action groups, screen SQL `$name` instead of `@name`,
GET bodies, function defaults using screen datasources, incomplete continuation
maps, literal non-scalar partition values, and custom script calls in guard, URL and
operation-configuration evaluation. Review intentional exceptions
against the installed runtime; do not suppress all findings.

Also inspect dropdown value projections, local/cloud table ownership, datasource
dependencies and transforms. The checker cannot establish UI behavior or successful
remote writes. Resolve SDK/runtime discrepancies from actual generated artifacts
and installed runtime code; a TypeScript cast is not evidence of a supported API.

## Match the execution boundary

Use sanitized real response fixtures preserving primitive types, nesting, missing
values and empty arrays. Test generated expressions with exactly the globals and
error behavior available at their evaluation point. Do not register helpers in a
test of a mobile guard that lacks solution script metadata. In the inspected local
REST runtime, these boundaries differ:

| Evaluation point | Solution scripts available? |
| --- | --- |
| Guard `when`, `result`, parameters | No |
| Request `url`, including continuation URL | No |
| Table-operation conditions, partition selectors, SQL configuration/parameters | No |
| Function output/input transform and table-operation `records` | Yes |

Use native JSONata at script-free boundaries; prepare complex results at a supported
boundary and consume typed output. Recheck the installed runtime when it changes.
Use real SQLite binding behavior for partition operations (see `datasources.md`).
A JavaScript throw may
be caught by expression evaluation and become null: it is not a reliable substitute
for a fail-closed guard before a remote write. Test that failure prevents HTTP.

## Smallest complete device journey

Exercise the affected flow in the specified app (e.g. Frontline):

1. Select parent and dependent dropdowns, close them, and confirm values persist.
2. Save locally, leave, reopen from the expected list and verify header/children.
   Include a discount and attachment when those features are being delivered.
3. Submit from the visible action and observe queued, processing, failure/success.
4. Read the remote record back and confirm the local remote id/state. Verify failed
   sends preserve work and retries of uncertain creates cannot duplicate records.
5. Verify visible completion after retry. A failed row disappearing is insufficient
   feedback; distinguish queued, remote saved, readback pending and complete states.

Use available debug/UI tools autonomously. If the phone cannot be operated by tools,
prepare all independent verification and request only the remaining device action.
A deployment needed for device testing is a test deployment until observed; do not
substitute a passing test count for missing device evidence.

## Evidence

Confirm pairing, solution and target app, then start capture before the action.
Capture restart may clear logs: persist useful sanitized evidence first. Correlate
record id, function, time, HTTP status and nested field errors. Never dump credentials,
request authorization headers or full debugger state into reports.

## Production logs

For a live solution, read at least two weeks of runtime logs before and after a fix.
Record events, users, devices, errors and warnings per app version. Group errors by
message with ids removed, rank by events and users, and match each group to a source
cause:

| Log signature | Usual cause | Read |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `UNIQUE constraint failed: <table>.id` | initialisation run twice or concurrently | `sync-orchestration.md` |
| function received undefined/null, `length of undefined` | missing or left-joined field | `jsonata-validation-formatting.md` |
| missing required parameter (employee, branch) | action ran before context loaded | `sync-orchestration.md` |
| `row value misused` | non-scalar SQL parameter | `datasources.md` |
| repeated 404 on the same entity | endpoint missing but still synced | `sync-orchestration.md` |
| entity ID missing, falling back to hash | output transform without `id` | `writes-and-duplicates.md` |
| Authorization header inside an error record | parameters logged with the event | `app-architecture.md` |

A group with a source match is confirmed; a static finding with no log trace is a risk.
Several app versions active at once means fixes do not reach everyone: report the spread
and compare error rates per version before blaming the solution. A fix is done when its
group falls to zero over a few days of use, not when it builds.

Review generated artifacts and actual failure evidence. Read back the published
configuration. Report static checks, live contract reads, local save/reopen and
remote submission/readback separately. Queue acceptance is not a successful save.
