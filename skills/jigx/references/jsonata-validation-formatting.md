# JSONata, Validation, Formatting, Dropdowns, And Icons

## JSONata

Keep expressions readable. Where solution script metadata is available, move complex
logic into a JavaScript function. Check the execution boundary in
`runtime-verification.md` before doing this for REST configuration.

Common rules:

- prefer explicit null checks for required fields
- keep case consistent in JSON paths
- avoid relying on jig state for persisted business values when component state or
  screen inputs are the source of truth
- use projected datasource fields for dropdown `value`

## Null-Safe Expressions

String and number functions throw on a missing value. Left-joined columns and optional
fields are missing often; in one audit a single `$contains` on a left-joined status in a
list item produced hundreds of runtime errors. Guard by type and choose a fallback by
meaning:

```yaml
when: =$contains(($type(@ctx.current.item.status)='string'?@ctx.current.item.status:''), 'Open')
text: =$type(@ctx.current.item.Amount)='number' ? $formatNumber(@ctx.current.item.Amount,'#,##0.00') : '-'
```

Show "Unknown" or "-" rather than a blank. Apply the same to `$substring`, `$lowercase`,
`$uppercase`, `$trim`, `$number`, `$round` and `$length`.

## Dropdowns

Dropdowns should:

- have stable `value` fields selected by the datasource SQL
- display a title users recognize
- include description/subtitle fields when they help selection
- sort by key/value first, then description
- use search for large lists

When binding dependent fields to a selected dropdown row, prefer direct selected data:

```text
=@ctx.components.InventoryID.state.selected.UnitPrice
```

Use the exact shape returned by the datasource. If SQL selected `UnitPrice`, do not
bind to `selected.data.UnitPrice.value` unless that is actually the returned shape.

## Validation

Separate:

- field-level required state
- form validity
- business readiness
- sync/submission readiness

Do not use hidden required fields that make a save button disabled without explaining
the missing requirement to the user.

For optional boolean controls, explicitly set `isRequired: false`: an unchecked
manual-price/discount choice is valid. Do not make optional notes required because a
separate description is required. Display prices from the selected datasource's actual
shape, but distinguish cached estimates from server-confirmed pricing.

## Formatting

Use native formatting configurations where available, for example currency formatting
on entity fields. If a numeric value is missing and the UI should show money, default
to zero instead of showing "not set".

## Icons

Use the SDK icon search MCP when an icon name is uncertain. Broken icons should be
treated as defects. Prefer explicit, known SDK icon names over guessed names.
