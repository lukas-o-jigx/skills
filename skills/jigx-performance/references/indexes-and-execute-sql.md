# Indexes And action.execute-sql

Prefer an index to a rewrite, and ship it so a failure cannot go unnoticed. `scripts/check-performance.mjs` flags predicates no shipped index matches, `execute-sql` actions with no `entities:`, and index DDL that names real tables.

## Indexes

- **Prefer an index to a rewrite.** An index cannot change a result set, so equivalence is structural
  rather than tested. Expression indexes took our worst query from 17 ms to 4 ms with no query change
  at all, for 82 KB of index and +0.29 ms per row written.
- **Match the predicate text exactly.** SQLite uses an expression index only when the indexed
  expression matches the query's. The table alias does not matter (`q.data` and `data` resolve to the
  same column); the function name, argument order, path string and any wrapping function do. Copy the
  predicate out of the datasource rather than retyping it.

  ```sql
  -- datasource: WHERE LOWER(COALESCE(json_extract(q.data, '$.status'), '')) = 'pending'
  CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_fileUploadQueue_status
  ON [fileUploadQueue] (LOWER(COALESCE(json_extract(data, '$.status'), '')))
  ```

- **Index the column the query reads.** An index on `json_extract(data, …)` does nothing for a filter
  on a `file` column.
- **An expression index must be deterministic.** SQLite rejects `CREATE INDEX` over a
  non-deterministic expression, so a column derived from `strftime('%s','now')` or similar (see
  `verifying.md`) cannot be indexed.
- **Don't wrap a predicate in a function.** `TRIM(COALESCE(json_extract(…'$.A'), json_extract(…'$.B')))`
  cannot use an index on either arm — 12 ms scan versus under 1 ms seek over 13,104 rows. Defensive
  `COALESCE` is not free.
- **Check the planner isn't already doing it.** Pushing a filter into each arm of a union, and fencing
  a multi-reference CTE with `LIMIT 2147483647`, are both things SQLite already does (the fence is a
  no-op on ≥ 3.35). Read the plan before writing the optimisation.
- **An `OR` across several keys scans unless every arm has a matching index.** SQLite can
  answer `a = ? OR b = ?` with one index per arm (`MULTI-INDEX OR` in the plan), but one
  unindexed or non-matching arm turns the whole lookup into a scan. A header looked up by
  any of four ids, once per queued change, read every header row per change: seconds per
  refresh at ~2,000 headers. Split it into one branch per key and index each branch's
  exact expression:

  ```sql
  SELECT h.id FROM [header] AS h WHERE trim(COALESCE(h.id, '')) = @key
  UNION
  SELECT h.id FROM [header] AS h WHERE trim(json_extract(h.data, '$.Nbr')) = @key
  -- … one branch per key; UNION, not UNION ALL, when one row can match two keys
  ```

  Check the branches return the same rows as the `OR` on real data, including null and
  empty keys. When the same multi-key lookup appears in several queries, build a small
  key table (`header id, key`) during sync instead, so each lookup is one indexed
  equality and the logic lives in one place.
- **Materialise a CTE that must be computed once.** Since 3.35 a CTE referenced more than
  once is materialised by default; one referenced once may be flattened into a correlated
  part of the outer query and re-parse its JSON per row. `WITH keys AS MATERIALIZED (…)`
  makes it explicit. It needs SQLite ≥ 3.35 on the device; check the plan shows
  `MATERIALIZE keys`.
- **One index per expression.** Two indexes on the same field with slightly different
  wrapping (`json_extract(…)` and `trim(json_extract(…))`) both cost writes; usually only
  one matches the queries. Drop the one no query uses.
- **Guard the plans that matter in CI.** `scripts/check-plans.py` builds the shipped
  indexes on stub tables and runs `EXPLAIN QUERY PLAN` on every datasource and
  `execute-sql` read. A guard file fails the build when a per-row or per-change lookup
  starts scanning, or stops using its index, after someone edits the query text:

  ```json
  {"changed-orders": {"no_scan": ["orders"], "uses": ["idx_orders_ref"]}}
  ```

- **Audit indexes no query uses.** The same report lists shipped indexes the planner
  never picks. It runs on empty tables without `ANALYZE`, so treat the list as candidates:
  confirm with `--schema-from` an exported database and the device's real query before
  dropping one. Every unused index still costs every write.

## `action.execute-sql`

- **`entities:` must be a non-empty array.** Omit it and the action fails on shape before a single
  statement runs.
- **Name a throwaway entity for DDL.** Listing the real tables invalidates every datasource bound to
  them and re-runs it (~6.6 s measured on device). An index changes no data, so use a table nothing
  binds to: `entities: [default/debug]`. This holds only while that table stays unbound: point any
  datasource at it and the trick silently becomes the ~6.6 s invalidation it exists to avoid.
- **Gate each `CREATE INDEX` on the table existing.** DYNAMIC (`default/*`) tables are created on
  first write. A step is one transaction, so one `no such table` on a fresh install takes every other
  index in that step down with it and raises error modals during the initial sync. Read
  `sqlite_master` into a datasource and gate on it:

  The `local-tables` datasource must read `sqlite_master` for the tables that exist on the device
  right now, and expose them under a `name` field, which is what the gate reads. It has to go to
  `sqlite_master` rather than `list_device_tables`, which omits the SDK system tables (see below).

  ```yaml
  when: ="default/growerVisitImages" in @ctx.datasources.local-tables.name
  ```

- **Keep new statements in a separate step** from proven ones, so a failure cannot drop indexes that
  already work.
- **Keep table creation out of the index step.** A `CREATE TABLE` must name its real entity so
  bound datasources refresh; an index step must not. Put each in its own action.
- **Run index DDL once per schema change, not on every sign-in or user change.** It belongs after
  the tables it indexes exist, outside the path the user waits on.
- **DDL failure is silent.** When an index build called at the tail of a sync fails, the sync scope
  still reads `state='synced'`, `failed = 0`. The sync scope gates nothing that DDL does.
- **Verify in `sqlite_master`, and nowhere else.** Indexes persist across publishes, so a non-empty
  listing from an older build reads exactly like success:

  ```sql
  SELECT name, sql FROM sqlite_master WHERE type='index' AND name LIKE 'idx_%';
  ```

  Remedy: either version the index name per build (`idx_<table>_<predicate>_v2`), so an old build's
  index cannot be mistaken for this build's, or `DROP INDEX IF EXISTS` immediately before the
  `CREATE` **in the same step**. Same step matters: a step is one transaction, so a drop that lands
  in an earlier step than its create leaves the table unindexed if the create step then fails.

- **`list_device_tables` omits the SDK system tables** (`_syncStatus`, `_syncScope`, `_fileStatus`,
  `_lastSync`). They exist and query fine. Use `sqlite_master` for inventory; `list_device_tables` is
  a liveness probe for when a query times out.
